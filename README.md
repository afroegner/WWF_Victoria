Water, Women, &amp; Fisheries

Lake Victoria provides food, drinking water, and livelihood for surrounding communities, but is impacted by increased resource demands and environmental stressors. We investigate the reliance of lakeshore fishery communities on the lake for drinking water and how nutrient pollution and water hyacinth impact its water quality. Our study focuses on Kisumu Bay, the most polluted portion of the lake, and combines social science (e.g., community surveys, focus group discussions) and ecological (e.g., manipulative experiments) approaches.
